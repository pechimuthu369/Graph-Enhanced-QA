LLM Fine-Tuning and Optimization + Agentic SOTA:

Objective: Demonstrate your understanding of LLM fine-tuning techniques relevant to graph-based agents.

- **Instructions:**
    - Provide a brief plan on how you would fine-tune an LLM using techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) or DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) for enhanced graph query responses.
    - This can be a written proposal (1-2 pages) where you outline the steps, required datasets, potential challenges, and how you'd measure success.


Introduction
This proposal outlines a strategy for fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance on graph query tasks.

1. DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) Implementation
    #Dataset Creation
        Compile a dataset of graph-related queries and responses
        Include both correct and incorrect responses for DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) training
        Example: "What is the shortest path between nodes A and B?" with corresponding graph representations    
    #Model Selection
        Choose a base LLM (e.g., LLaMA-2 7B or Mistral 7B)
        Tools: Hugging Face Transformers library
    #DPO Fine-Tuning        
        Dataset
            Create pairs of responses (preferred vs. non-preferred) for graph queries
            Example: Correct path vs. incorrect path for shortest path queries
        Training
            Apply DPO using the preference dataset
            Tools: TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) library
    #Example code snippet:
        from trl import DPOTrainer
        dpo_trainer = DPOTrainer(model=model, args=training_args, beta=0.1)
        dpo_trainer.train() 

2. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Implementation 
    #Setup
        Configure LoRA adapters for efficient fine-tuning
        Tools: PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) library -  is a library for efficiently adapting large pretrained models to various downstream applications.
    #Training
        Use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with LoRA
        Focus on graph-specific vocabulary and reasoning
    #Example code snippet:
        from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
        lora_config = LoraConfig(r=8, lora_alpha=32, target_modules=["query", "value"])
        model = get_peft_model(base_model, lora_config)

3. potential challenges
    #Data Quality
        Ensure diverse and accurate graph query examples
    #Overfitting
        Risk of model specializing too narrowly on graph queries    

4. Measure success
    #Query response times: - Measure how long it takes for graph-related queries.
    #Accuracy on graph query tasks: - Evaluate the model's performance with baseline model.
    #Human evaluation: - Conduct human evaluations to assess quality of the response.
    #Inference speed: - Compare the fine-tuned model's inference speed with baseline model.
    #Cache hit ratios: - Monitor the percentage of queries served from cache vs those requiring data fetching.
    #Scalability - Assess the model's performance at time of increase in graphs input.
